        I’m a Front-end developer with nearly a year of self-study experience in building web application (ReactJS). I love learning new technologies and building valuable application that helps others with their work. I’m considered a team-player because I like to help other and tend to work well within the group. My goal is to be a good Front-end developer, and possibly a full stack web developer.
